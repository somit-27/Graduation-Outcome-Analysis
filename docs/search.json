    "text": "1 Introduction\nEducation is a critical pillar of societal development, and graduation outcomes serve as a fundamental metric of student success and equity in educational systems. This project focuses on graduation results for New York City high schools from Cohorts 2012 to 2019 (Classes of 2016 to 2023), as reported by the New York City Department of Education. By analyzing trends in graduation rates, diploma types (Regents, Advanced Regents, Local), and dropout rates across various geographic subdivisions, we aim to uncover disparities and opportunities for improvement. This exploration is particularly relevant to policymakers, educators, and researchers seeking to enhance equity and effectiveness in education.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nData Source : The dataset, titled “Graduation results for Cohorts 2012 to 2019 (Classes of 2016 to 2023),” is published by the New York City Department of Education via NYC OpenData. It provides detailed annual statistics on graduation outcomes, including cohort size, graduation rates, diploma types, enrollment status, and dropout rates.\nData Collection : The data follows the New York State Education Department’s methodology, defining a cohort as students who first entered 9th grade in a specific school year. Graduates are defined as those earning either a Local or Regents diploma. The dataset is updated annually, ensuring it reflects the most recent statistics.\nData Format : The dataset is presented in a tabular format, containing 29 columns and multiple rows for each geographic subdivision or school. Key fields include: - Cohort Year: Year of entry into 9th grade. - % Grads: Percentage of graduates in a cohort. - Dropout: Number of students who dropped out. - % Advanced Regents of Cohort: Percentage of students earning an Advanced Regents diploma relative to the cohort.\nData Frequency and Updates : The dataset is updated annually, with the most recent data available as of April 4, 2024. This ensures consistency and relevance for long-term trend analysis.\nIssues and challenges:\nData Import : The dataset is available as a downloadable CSV file on NYC OpenData. It can be imported using data analysis tools like R or Python. Libraries such as pandas or data.table in Python or readr in R will be used for efficient data manipulation and exploration.\nSource Documentation : The dataset can be accessed at NYC OpenData. Additional details on the data collection methodology are provided by the New York State Education Department.\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)  \n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)      \nlibrary(visdat)     \nlibrary(skimr)     \nlibrary(ggdendro)\nCode\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Graduate Results.csv\", \n                 show_col_types = FALSE)\nCode\ncat(\"Number of rows:\", nrow(data), \"\\n\")\n\n\nNumber of rows: 321002 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Number of columns:\", ncol(data), \"\\n\")\n\n\nNumber of columns: 29\nCode\ncat(\"Column names:\\n\")\n\n\nColumn names:\n\n\nCode\nprint(colnames(data))\n\n\n [1] \"Report Category\"                     \n [2] \"Geographic Subdivision\"              \n [3] \"School Name\"                         \n [4] \"Category\"                            \n [5] \"Cohort Year\"                         \n [6] \"Cohort\"                              \n [7] \"# Total Cohort\"                      \n [8] \"# Grads\"                             \n [9] \"% Grads\"                             \n[10] \"# Total Regents\"                     \n[11] \"% Total Regents of Cohort\"           \n[12] \"% Total Regents of Grads\"            \n[13] \"# Advanced Regents\"                  \n[14] \"% Advanced Regents of Cohort\"        \n[15] \"% Advanced Regents of Grads\"         \n[16] \"# Regents without Advanced\"          \n[17] \"% Regents without Advanced of Cohort\"\n[18] \"% Regents without Advanced of Grads\" \n[19] \"# Local\"                             \n[20] \"% Local of Cohort\"                   \n[21] \"% Local of Grads\"                    \n[22] \"# Still Enrolled\"                    \n[23] \"% Still Enrolled\"                    \n[24] \"# Dropout\"                           \n[25] \"% Dropout\"                           \n[26] \"# SACC (IEP Diploma)\"                \n[27] \"% SACC (IEP Diploma) of Cohort\"      \n[28] \"# TASC (GED)\"                        \n[29] \"% TASC (GED) of Cohort\"              \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"\\nSummary of the dataset:\\n\")\n\n\n\nSummary of the dataset:\n\n\nCode\nprint(summary(data))\n\n\n Report Category    Geographic Subdivision School Name       \n Length:321002      Length:321002          Length:321002     \n Class :character   Class :character       Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character       Mode  :character  \n                                                             \n                                                             \n                                                             \n   Category          Cohort Year      Cohort          #

Columns like “% Advanced Regents of Grads” and “% Total Regents of Grads” are closely grouped, indicating similar missingness behavior. Broader separations between clusters signify distinct missingness patterns across groups of variables. This structure helps identify patterns for imputation or exclusion, ensuring efficient handling of missing data while preserving relationships within clustered variables.",
