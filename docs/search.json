    "text": "1 Introduction\nEducation is a critical pillar of societal development, and graduation outcomes serve as a fundamental metric of student success and equity in educational systems. This project focuses on graduation results for New York City high schools from Cohorts 2012 to 2019 (Classes of 2016 to 2023), as reported by the New York City Department of Education. By analyzing trends in graduation rates, diploma types (Regents, Advanced Regents, Local), and dropout rates across various geographic subdivisions, we aim to uncover disparities and opportunities for improvement. This exploration is particularly relevant to policymakers, educators, and researchers seeking to enhance equity and effectiveness in education.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nData Source : The dataset, titled “Graduation results for Cohorts 2012 to 2019 (Classes of 2016 to 2023),” is published by the New York City Department of Education via NYC OpenData. It provides detailed annual statistics on graduation outcomes, including cohort size, graduation rates, diploma types, enrollment status, and dropout rates.\nData Collection : The data follows the New York State Education Department’s methodology, defining a cohort as students who first entered 9th grade in a specific school year. Graduates are defined as those earning either a Local or Regents diploma. The dataset is updated annually, ensuring it reflects the most recent statistics.\nData Format : The dataset is presented in a tabular format, containing 29 columns and multiple rows for each geographic subdivision or school. Key fields include: - Cohort Year: Year of entry into 9th grade. - % Grads: Percentage of graduates in a cohort. - Dropout: Number of students who dropped out. - % Advanced Regents of Cohort: Percentage of students earning an Advanced Regents diploma relative to the cohort.\nData Frequency and Updates : The dataset is updated annually, with the most recent data available as of April 4, 2024. This ensures consistency and relevance for long-term trend analysis.\nIssues and challenges:\nData Import : The dataset is available as a downloadable CSV file on NYC OpenData. It can be imported using data analysis tools like R or Python. Libraries such as pandas or data.table in Python or readr in R will be used for efficient data manipulation and exploration.\nSource Documentation : The dataset can be accessed at NYC OpenData. Additional details on the data collection methodology are provided by the New York State Education Department.\nCode\nsuppressMessages(library(tidyverse))  \nlibrary(readr)      \nlibrary(visdat)     \nlibrary(skimr)     \nlibrary(ggdendro)\nCode\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Graduate Results.csv\", \n                 show_col_types = FALSE)\nCode\ncat(\"Number of rows:\", nrow(data), \"\\n\")\n\n\nNumber of rows: 321002 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Number of columns:\", ncol(data), \"\\n\")\n\n\nNumber of columns: 29\nCode\ncat(\"Column names:\\n\")\n\n\nColumn names:\n\n\nCode\nprint(colnames(data))\n\n\n [1] \"Report Category\"                     \n [2] \"Geographic Subdivision\"              \n [3] \"School Name\"                         \n [4] \"Category\"                            \n [5] \"Cohort Year\"                         \n [6] \"Cohort\"                              \n [7] \"# Total Cohort\"                      \n [8] \"# Grads\"                             \n [9] \"% Grads\"                             \n[10] \"# Total Regents\"                     \n[11] \"% Total Regents of Cohort\"           \n[12] \"% Total Regents of Grads\"            \n[13] \"# Advanced Regents\"                  \n[14] \"% Advanced Regents of Cohort\"        \n[15] \"% Advanced Regents of Grads\"         \n[16] \"# Regents without Advanced\"          \n[17] \"% Regents without Advanced of Cohort\"\n[18] \"% Regents without Advanced of Grads\" \n[19] \"# Local\"                             \n[20] \"% Local of Cohort\"                   \n[21] \"% Local of Grads\"                    \n[22] \"# Still Enrolled\"                    \n[23] \"% Still Enrolled\"                    \n[24] \"# Dropout\"                           \n[25] \"% Dropout\"                           \n[26] \"# SACC (IEP Diploma)\"                \n[27] \"% SACC (IEP Diploma) of Cohort\"      \n[28] \"# TASC (GED)\"                        \n[29] \"% TASC (GED) of Cohort\"              \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"\\nSummary of the dataset:\\n\")\n\n\n\nSummary of the dataset:\n\n\nCode\nprint(summary(data))\n\n\n Report Category    Geographic Subdivision School Name       \n Length:321002      Length:321002          Length:321002     \n Class :character   Class :character       Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character       Mode  :character  \n                                                             \n                                                             \n                                                             \n   Category          Cohort Year      Cohort          #

Columns like “% Advanced Regents of Grads” and “% Total Regents of Grads” are closely grouped, indicating similar missingness behavior. Broader separations between clusters signify distinct missingness patterns across groups of variables. This structure helps identify patterns for imputation or exclusion, ensuring efficient handling of missing data while preserving relationships within clustered variables.",

A clear pattern emerges, with minimal student counts observed for years before 2012, followed by a sharp and sustained increase beginning in 2012. This marks a significant shift in the dataset’s scope and reliability.\nPre-2012 Data: The student counts from 2000 to 2011 are notably low, represented by red labels to emphasize their sparseness. This is likely due to incomplete or inconsistent data collection processes prior to 2012. These discrepancies in earlier years reflect the dataset’s limitations and necessitated their exclusion during preprocessing to maintain data integrity. Removing pre-2012 data ensures that the analysis focuses on cohorts tracked using a consistent methodology and avoids inaccuracies stemming from incomplete records.\nPost-2012 Data: From 2012 onward, there is a marked surge in student counts, which remains steady until 2018. This consistency suggests either improved data tracking systems or an actual increase in 9th-grade enrollments, possibly driven by policy changes, population growth, or enhanced reporting mechanisms. The dataset’s title, “Graduation results for Cohorts 2012 to 2019,” confirms that it is specifically designed to track these later cohorts with detailed and standardized data.\n\n\nCode\n# Histogram\nggplot(data_clean, aes(x = `% Grads`)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of % Grads\",\n       x = \"% Grads\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of % Grads: This histogram shows the frequency distribution of graduation percentages across the cohort dataset.

Each demographic group is represented by a density curve, showing how the percentages of Advanced Regents diplomas are distributed within that group. The peaks in the curves indicate the most common values for each category, and the groups are ordered by their median percentages, from highest to lowest.\nKey observations reveal that “Female Asian” and “Male Asian” categories have higher peaks at higher percentages, suggesting a larger proportion of students in these groups earn Advanced Regents diplomas. Similarly, “Female White” and “Male Multi-Racial” also exhibit relatively high medians, while “Female Native American” appears at the bottom of the plot, indicating lower median percentages. The use of distinct colors for each category and the overlapping ridgelines provide a clear visual comparison of achievements among groups.\nThis plot offers valuable insights into the disparities and successes in earning Advanced Regents diplomas among different demographic groups, highlighting those with higher achievements. These findings can inform educational policies and support strategies to address the observed disparities.\n\n\nCode\ndata_filtered &lt;- data_clean %&gt;%\n  filter(`Cohort Year` &gt;= 2012) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Graduation_Status = case_when(\n      `% Grads` &gt;= 80 ~ \"Graduated\",\n      `% Dropout` &gt;= 10 ~ \"Dropout\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Not Graduated\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Group by 'Cohort Year' and 'Graduation Status' and calculate the counts\ndata_grouped &lt;- data_filtered %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Cohort Year`, Graduation_Status) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Create the updated diverging stacked bar chart\nggplot(data_grouped, aes(x = reorder(`Cohort Year`, desc(`Cohort Year`)), y = count, fill = Graduation_Status)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"fill\", width = 0.7) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Graduation and Dropout Rates by Cohort Year (2012 and Later)\",\n    x = \"Cohort Year\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    fill = \"Graduation Status\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Graduated\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"Dropout\" = \"#a6cee3\", \"Not Graduated\" = \"#cccccc\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(count / sum(count), accuracy = 1)), \n            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⁠Diverging Stacked Bar Chart of Graduation Status by Cohort Year: This visualization illustrates the breakdown of graduation statuses (Graduated, Not Graduated, Dropout) over cohort years, showing an increasing trend in graduation rates for recent years.\n\n\nCode\n# Load required libraries\n\n\n# Load NYC borough shapefile using tigris\nnyc_boroughs &lt;- counties(state = \"NY\", cb = TRUE, progress = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  filter(NAME %in% c(\"New York\", \"Richmond\", \"Queens\", \"Kings\", \"Bronx\"))\n\n\nRetrieving data for the year 2022\n\n\nCode\n# Load dataset\n# Replace 'data' with your dataset containing graduation rates and borough information\ndata_b &lt;- tibble(\n  Borough = c(\"Manhattan\", \"Staten Island\", \"Queens\", \"Brooklyn\", \"Bronx\"),\n  GradRate = c(85.3, 82.5, 83.7, 81.2, 77.5)\n)\n\n# Map borough names to match shapefile\ndata_b &lt;- data_b %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    NAME = case_when(\n      Borough == \"Manhattan\" ~ \"New York\",\n      Borough == \"Staten Island\" ~ \"Richmond\",\n      Borough == \"Brooklyn\" ~ \"Kings\",\n      TRUE ~ Borough\n    )\n  )\n\n# Merge shapefile and data\nnyc_boroughs &lt;- nyc_boroughs %&gt;%\n  left_join(data_b, by = \"NAME\")\n\n# Plot the choropleth with labels and sequential blue color scheme\nggplot(nyc_boroughs) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = GradRate), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_sf_text(aes(label = Borough), size = 4, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Blues\", direction = 1, name = \"Grad Rate (%)\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"NYC Borough-Wise Graduation Rates\",\n    subtitle = \"Filtered for Accurate Boroughs with Proper Labels\",\n    caption = \"Data Source: NYC Graduation Rates Dataset\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⁠Graduation Rates by Borough and Demographic Category: This heatmap compares graduation rates across boroughs and demographic categories, with darker shades indicating higher graduation percentages.
