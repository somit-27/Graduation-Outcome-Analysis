# Introduction

Education is a critical pillar of societal development, and graduation outcomes serve as a fundamental metric of student success and equity in educational systems. This project focuses on graduation results for New York City high schools from Cohorts 2012 to 2019 (Classes of 2016 to 2023), as reported by the New York City Department of Education. By analyzing trends in graduation rates, diploma types (Regents, Advanced Regents, Local), and dropout rates across various geographic subdivisions, we aim to uncover disparities and opportunities for improvement. This exploration is particularly relevant to policymakers, educators, and researchers seeking to enhance equity and effectiveness in education.
