    The graph explains us the percentage of students that graduated who took a 4 year course which ended in August. The graph is divided borough wise in NYC so it is better to view one borough at a time and see the trend from 2019 to 2012. By hovering on the bar we can see the exact percentage of graduates. We can see a general trend among all the boroughs that the percentage of graduated students increase from 2012 to 2019. Queens has the highest percentage of graduated students in the year of 2019 which is 86.80%.
